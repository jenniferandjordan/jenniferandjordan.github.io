                    About six years ago, Jennifer and Jordan were introduced by a mutual friend (…or friends, depending on who you ask). They went from complete strangers, to friends of friends, to inseparable college sweethearts. This is their story.

                  <p>During a night out with friends in Harvard Square, Jennifer and Jordan finally speak for the first time. They bond over food, particularly sushi. Inspiration strikes and he (sort of) asks Jennifer out on a first date of sushi making.</p>
                  <p>Note: Jordan was unclear if he actually asked Jennifer out. So he did what anyone would do in his position. He called to confirm their dinner, an act which Jennifer still makes fun of to this day.</p>

He anxiously lugs home a bag full of raw fish, seaweed, vegetables, rice and Japanese beer. Despite convincing Jennifer that he is basically a professional sushi chef, this is the first time he’s actually made real sushi. He spends the next several hours meticulously cleaning every inch of the apartment, crafting the perfect iTunes play list, prepping the kitchen…and drinking alone to settle his nerves.</p>

A first date leads to a second date (this time Jordan was a little less ambitious with the preparations…but still called Jennifer to confirm), which leads to a third date, which we all know leads to…a fourth date (get your mind out of the gutter).</p>

                    After many more dates, binge watching all 6 seasons of Lost and graduation from Tufts, they were in love and talking future. Jordan was already committed to a job in The Big Apple, so off to New York he went. Jennifer returned to Los Angeles, where she planned to hunt for East Coast jobs.

                    Jordan and Jen see each other exactly 3 times during their 2 years together in New York City (…not precisely, but you get the idea). It’s time for Jennifer to steal Jordan away to LA LA Land.
